        Brian Lange is a student in the Computer Engineering program at Northwestern University. He also spends co-op quarters as a Data Scientist at Datascope Analytics, where he leads design process exercises and designs analyses, web interfaces and visualizations. Brian believes that human centered design coupled with the latest technology can make our planet more sustainable. While he's not nerding out about information density and saving the world, he enjoys science and comedy podcasts, making beer, and listening to weird music.
